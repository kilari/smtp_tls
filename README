"I am not the author for this smtp_tls file so I bear no responsibility"

How to use:

1>Check out this smtp_tls.rb file to the location of the file where you have the code which sends mails using your gmail account.
2>Add require 'smtp_tls' to your can it should start working.
3>Below is a sample code for sending mails using ruby Net::SMTP

msgstr = <<END_OF_MESSAGE
From: VPSDOWNALERT <vpsdownalert@gmail.com>
Subject: Down Alert
Your VPS IS DOWN
END_OF_MESSAGE
smtp = Net::SMTP.start('smtp.gmail.com', 25, 'gmail.com', 'vpsdownalert@gmail.com', '***', :login)
smtp.send_message msgstr, 'vpsdownalert@gmail.com', 'vamsikilari@kilari.co.in'
smtp.finish

The other option would be to use a block so that we need not close the connection manually using finish.
